# SnakeGameInCpp
Defined Point, and implemented the Snake and Food classes. The Snake uses a vector for its body, allowing efficient movement and growth, and Food handles respawning. The game logic is primarily encapsulated within the main Game class. I've abandoned the map-based approach in favor of drawing based on coordinates. Input handling and collision detection are now integrated, and I am prioritizing a clean, modular structure.

Self-contained, single-file solution that compiles cleanly. My code includes the Position struct, Food class, Snake class (with move(), grow(), checkCollision()), and the main Game class with its core methods.
